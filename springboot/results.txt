Using OpenSSL Binary /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2o_2/bin/openssl, override with $OPENSSL_COMMAND
Running benchmarks with OpenSSL version OpenSSL 1.0.2o  27 Mar 2018

The X/user sec metric means X connections per second spend in user mode. This is excluding the kernel time. The first
value is more interesting, it shows the total amount of connections established in 30 seconds wall-clock time. Using
OpenSSL is distinctly better than using Java 10, which again is better twice as good as using Java 8.
